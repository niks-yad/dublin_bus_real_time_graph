# Dublin Bus Route Finder

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of various graph traversal and shortest path algorithms to find and optimize routes in a simulated bus network in Dublin. The project includes implementations of Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Dijkstra's Algorithm.

## Features
- **DFS and BFS Implementation:** Allows traversal of the bus network to explore possible routes.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Computes the shortest path between two bus stops efficiently, essential for route optimization.
- **File Parsing:** Includes utilities to load and parse data from CSV files representing the bus network.

## Installation
Clone this repository using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dublin-bus-route-finder.git
